# Battleship
A simple game made in python.

In this simple game a multidimensional list is created (5x5).  A random point is generated.
First the game ask the user for how many attempts to try to sunk the ship, then it ask about
the coordinates, row x col.  If the user guessed correctly the game is over and a message is
displayed if not the games continues until the amount of attempts is reached.
